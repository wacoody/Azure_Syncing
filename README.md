# Azure_Syncing

This script runs either a delta or initial sync to Azure.



There are two ways these scripts can be used. One which can run directly on a Domain Controller and the other which can be ran from any other server.

For running on a Domain Controller directly, refer to the "DC_script.txt".

To run on other systems using the `invoke-command`, refer to either respective .ps1 file.
